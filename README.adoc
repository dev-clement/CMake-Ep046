= CMake sanitizers
Using CMake will let you use sanitizer, in order (for instance) to detecting memory leaks, or memory issues in your code upon runtime. After the compilation itself.

== Intoduction
NOTE: Sanitizer is a tool that let you check your memory, if there are any memory issues or pointar access invalid in runtime of course.

IMPORTANT: CMake sanitizer can process your code upon compiling in order to detect issues that can arises while running it, and everything can be happening before compiling your code.

== Tools for sanitizer
In order to use CMake at full-scale, you will have 3 tools that CMake provides:

. Clang-tidy being a static linter (before compiling), a tool that lets you problem *BEFORE* even compiling the project.
. Compile time issues 
. Sanitizers at runtime

NOTE: These tools are tool that can be used in order to have a code more safe, and also helps you to find bugs.

== Enable sanitizer
Before using the sanitizer, we need to create an `option` command in your CMake root that enable the sanitizer or not:

```cmake
option(ENABLE_ADDRESS_SANITIZER "Enable address sanitizer" ON)
option(ENABLE_UNDEFINED_SANITIZER "Enable undefined sanitier" ON)
```

NOTE: These tools of sanitizers depends on the compiler you are using, for instance, if you are using MSVC, only the address sanitizer is implemented !

So these `Ã²ptions` command can be triggered as a `ON` or `OFF` value, and in case of it's `ON`, the following happens:

```cmake
if (ENABLE_ADDRESS_SANITIZER OR ENABLE_UNDEFINED_SANITIZER)
    include(Sanitizers)
endif()
```

So in case one of both sanitizers is available, we are including the `Sanitizerd.cmake` file that will be contains the Sanitizers:

== Sanitizers.cmake
In order to implement the `Sanitizers.cmake` file, you should take the following file:

```cmake
function(add_sanitizer_flags)
    if (NOT ${ENABLE_ADDRESS_SANITIZER} AND NOT ${ENABLE_UNDEFINED_SANITIZER})
        message(STATUS "No sanitizers actived !")
        return()
    endif()

    if (CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "CLANG" OR CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "GNU")
        add_compile_options("-fno-omit-frame-pointer")
        add_link_options("-fno-omit-frame-pointer")

        if (${ENABLE_ADDRESS_SANITIZER})
            add_compile_options("-fsanitize=address")
            add_link_options("-fsanitize=address")
        endif()

        if (${ENABLE_UNDEFINED_SANITIZER})
            add_compile_options("-fsanitize=undefined")
            add_link_options("-fsanitize=undefined")
        endif()
    elseif (CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "MSVC")
        if (${ENABLE_ADDRESS_SANITIZER})
            add_compile_options("/fsanitize=address")
        endif()

        if (${ENABLE_UNDEFINED_SANITIZER})
            message(STATUS "Undefined sanitizer not impl. for MSVC")
        endif()
    else
        message(ERROR "Compiler not supported for Sanitizers")
    endif()

    target_compile_options(${TARGET} PRIVATE ${WARNINGS})
    message(STATUS ${WARNINGS})

endfunction()
```
The function passed above is the implementation of the sanitizer for GNU/CLANG/MSVC, which is looking like the same file as `Warnings.cmake` but with usage of the `add_compile_options` and `add_link_options`.

IMPORTANT: Once you've implemented the above function, you'll now be able to run it in the root `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
if (ENABLE_ADDRESS_SANITIZER OR ENABLE_UNDEFINED_SANITIZER)
    include(Sanitizers)
    add_sanitizer_flags()
endif()
```

== Example of sanitizer usage

NOTE: So now we have the possibility to either enable or disable the sanitizer. However, what can we do with it ?

Go to your main.cpp from the `app` for example:
```cpp
int main() {
    std::cout   << project_name << std::endl
                << project_version_major << "." << project_version_minor << "." << project_version_patch << std::endl;

    std::cout   << "JSON Lib version:"
                << NLOHMANN_JSON_VERSION_MAJOR << "."
                << NLOHMANN_JSON_VERSION_MINOR << "."
                << NLOHMANN_JSON_VERSION_PATCH << "."
                << std::endl;
    print_hello_world();
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

```
Then add an array of int like so:
```cpp
int main() {
    std::cout   << project_name << std::endl
                << project_version_major << "." << project_version_minor << "." << project_version_patch << std::endl;

    int x[2];
    x[2] = 1337

```
As you can see, we declare an array of 2 elements, and we initialize the value at index `2` to be of value 1337. *HOWEVER* that's not supposed to work.

The following code:
```cpp
int x[2];
x[2] = ???
```
shall return an undefined behavior, and that's kind of tricky to find it in case of your code being a way too big. So it should return an undefined behavior.

But, when you're compiling your application, it works fine because the compiler isn't looking for such kind of things.

=== Advantage of sanitizer
If you aren't using the sanitizer, you may come across a problem like this one, however, you might not have all the clues that the sanitizer will show you once he'll pass through that line, you should see something like this:

image::address_sanitizer_example.png[]

So as we saw above, we are making use of the sanitizer of the compiler directly, a sanitizer for GCC or MSVC, still, there is one that is good and that can be used everywhere that is `Clang-tidy`.

== Clang-Tidy
Clang-tidy is a link:https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html[LibTooling]-based tool, and it's easier to work with if your set up a compile command database for your project (for instance of how to do this, see link:https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html[How To Setup Tooling For LLVM]. You can also specify compilation options on the command line after `--`

```shell
$ clang-tidy test.cpp -- -Imy_project/include -DMY_DEFINES ...
```
If there are too many options or source files to specify on the command line, you can store them in a parameter file, and then use `clang-tidy` with that parameter file:
```cmake
$ clang-tidy @parameter_file
```

NOTE: `Clang-tidy` has its own checks and can alwo run Clang Static Analizer checks. Each check has a name and the checks to run can be chosen using the `-checks=options`, which specifies a comma-separated list of positive and negative (prefixed with a `-`) globs. Positive globs add subsets of checks, and negative ones remove them. For example:

```shell
$ clang-tidy test.exe --checks=-*,clang-analyzer-*,-clang-analyzer=cplusplus*.
```

NOTE: This command will disable default checks (`-*`) and enabe all `clang-analyzer-*` checks except for `clang-analyzer-cplusplus*` ones.

=== Enable Clang-tidy
In order to use the Clang-tidy in your CMake, we can use one CMake function that is already created:

NOTE: The first thing that needs to be activated is the Link Time Optimization compilation process.

==== Example of LTO
The following example illustrates the advantages of LTO's integrated approach and clean interface. This example requires a system linker which supports LTO through the interface describe in the following code. Here, clang transparently invokes system linker.

* Input source file `a.cpp` is compiled into LLVM bitcode form.
* Input source file `main.cpp` is compiled into native object code.

```cpp
--- a.h ---
extern int foo1(void);
extern void foo2(void);
extern void foo4(void);

--- a.c ---
#include "a.h"

static signed int i = 0;

void foo2(void) {
  i = -1;
}

static int foo3() {
  foo4();
  return 10;
}

int foo1(void) {
  int data = 0;

  if (i < 0)
    data = foo3();

  data = data + 42;
  return data;
}

--- main.c ---
#include <stdio.h>
#include "a.h"

void foo4(void) {
  printf("Hi\n");
}

int main() {
  return foo1();
}
```
Indeed we can compile it and run it using clang like this:
```shell
$ clang -flto -c a.c -o a.o        # <-- a.o is LLVM bitcode file
$ clang -c main.c -o main.o        # <-- main.o is native object file
$ clang -flto a.o main.o -o main   # <-- standard link command with -flto
```
But we can do it using CMake, and the first step is going to be create a new file in your `cmake` directory named `LTO.cmake` that contains the following:
```cmake
# Since CMake 3.9, its almost predefined by CMake to enable this for certain compilers.
function(target_enable_lto TARGET ENABLE)
    if (NOT ${ENABLE})
        return()
    endif()

    # Same LTO but smaller than before, this include avoid
    # hundreds of lines of configurations !
    include(CheckIPOSupported)
    check_ipo_supported(RESULT result OUTPUT output)

    if (result)
        message(STATUS "LPO/LTO is supported !")
        set_property(TARGET ${TARGET} PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION ${ENABLE})
    else()
        message(WARNING "IPO/LTO isn't supported !")
    endif()
endfunction(target_enable_lto)
```
In the main `CMakeLists.txt` we will also create a new option like the following:
```cmake
option(ENABLE_LTO "Enable Clang LTO" ON)
...
if (ENABLE_LTO)
    include(LTO)
endif()
```
Then you can call this method on specific `CMakeLists.txt`, such as the lib or the executable, just add the followings into it:
```cmake
if (${ENABLE_LTO})
    target_enable_lto(${LIBRARY_NAME} ${ENABLE_LTO})
endif()
```
